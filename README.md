# CharityChecker
A browser extension that gives you the lowdown on your favorite charity sites. Make informed donations!

## Inspiration
Many of us have seen articles like "How the American Red Cross Spends Your Donations" or "Think Before You Donate to Goodwill," but few people want to search up the credibility of each charity they're considering, and some charities don't have articles written about them. 
We wanted to increase the transparency in charity spending reports, and the ease with which donors can search that up. 

## What it does
Charity Checker automatically pulls relevant information about a charity when you are on their website. It lets you see what percentage of your dollar actually goes to support the cause, and also gives you more detailed information about the charity's financial accountability, potential concerns, credibility ratings, and more. 

## How we built it

## Challenges we ran into

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
All of our team members were new to Chrome extensions, Javascript, HTML, using APIs, and Alexa Skills Kit, and it was the first hackathon some of us have ever done, so we're proud of the amount we learned within 36 hours! We're also proud that we got to build a working prototype and of how well we worked as a team!
