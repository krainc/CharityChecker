# CharityChecker
A Chrome browser extension that automatically pulls relevant information when you are on a charity website. See where your money goes, who gets what, potential concerns, credibility ratings, and more. Make informed donations!

## Inspiration
Many of us have seen articles like "How the American Red Cross Spends Your Donations" or "Think Before You Donate to Goodwill."
But few people want to search up the credibility of each charity they're considering, and some charities don't have articles written about them. 
We wanted to increase the transparency in charity spending reports, and the ease with which donors can search that up.
